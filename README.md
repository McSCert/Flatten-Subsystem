# Flatten Subsystem Tool

The Flatten Subsystem tool automatically flattens a Simulink subsystem, that
is, it moves the subsystem contents up one level, reconnects the signals, and
removes the subsystem block. This tool is useful for making quick transformations
to a model by automating the tedious task of manually copying and connecting
the many elements contained in a subsystem.

*Note: This functionality has been since included in Matlab/Simulink 2014a
as the \Expand Subsystem" operation. This tool is still beneficial for earlier
versions of Matlab/Simulink, as well as handling more types of subsystems*
